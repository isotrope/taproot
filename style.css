Description: Taproot is a lightweight yet powerful starter theme that can be customized and extended to fit a wide variety of needs.

There are plenty of actions and filters for developers to be able to change or extend the theme components without requiring custom theme templates. Whether you need something clean, simple and ready to go, or a base for a feature rich custom site, Taproot may be just what you're looking for.
